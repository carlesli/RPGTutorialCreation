Time ago, the boxes of the video games came with a manual that came with all the controls and mechanics written. Those manuals were thought to be read before the player started to play, but sometimes there are concepts that are very difficult to understand just by reading a text from a book. With the rise of the digital evolution, less people read these manuals, and some others even didn’t know that existed, so an efficient solution was to do an in-game tutorial, due to the game itself is the only place to learn how to play it.
	And this is how tutorials were created, but it is also important to know what a tutorial is. Can be defined as any tool that teaches the player to play the game (its mechanics, controls, etc). Depending on the design of the game, tutorials can have various types, from the tutorial that gives an easy beginning to the player to the tutorial that forces the player to learn via trial and error.

Before start doing a tutorial, it is important to have into account which type of gameplay we want to have and which type we will use, because it is not the same a tutorial that shows everything very slowly in a game that has a fast gameplay, so here there are different types of tutorials and examples of them with RPG video games:

-> Antepiece: An easier version of the obstacle precedes the real one. Some examples that video games use this type of tutorial are in The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask at the start of the game, where you recently get transformed into deku and the first room there are few flowers that allow you to fly. This room is bottomless so the player can practice flying safely.

Another example we can see it in the game Kingdom Hearts II, in the tutorial section with Roxas, the player receives great damage and prepares the player to all the situations that will have to enfront. The fact is that in this zone there is no game over, so the player can practise as all as he wants.

-> Auto-Pilot Tutorial: The tutorial that the player can look but can’t play it. The first example that comes to our mind most probably is the catching tutorial in the Pokemon franchise, where an NPC teaches the player the basis of how to catch pokemon.

Another example is in the game Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story, where if the player chooses to practise, the game shows the move to let the player see how it is done.

-> Forced Tutorial: As its name says it, this tutorial is one that the player is forced to do even if it is in a New Game+. The MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a mandatory tutorial every time the player makes a new character.

Another example we find with this type of tutorial is again in the The Legend of Zelda franchise, but this game is Wind Waker, where at the start of the game, the player has a small tutorial with some NPCs to know the mechanics of the game, and this will be applied even if the player is reaching a NewGame+.

-> Justified tutorial: These tutorials provide a special in-continuity tutorial section which allows the player to learn how the game works without forcing it. In either case, these tutorials are part of the game’s universe and seem so easy to implement, but in games that have different difficulty playthroughs this tutorial is not possible in the most difficult ones. One game that applies this tutorial is the first game of Dark Souls. At the beginning of this game the character has to escape from an asylum that is full of enemies and the first boss of the game. It teaches the basic controls and shows that the direct way isn’t always the best.

Another game that applies this tutorial is the title Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, where the Djinn tutorial is given by Isaac, who is the hero of the previous game.

-> Signpost Tutorial: This tutorial offers in-game instructions on how to play  through some feature of the game world. The instructions can be either part of the background or in posters that can be read by the player. We can see that more games use this type due to it letting the player explore on his own and read everything carefully or go on and skip this tutorial. The title Holy Umbrella has these signposts in the side view levels that tells the player which way should go.

Another title that has this type is in Pokemon, where the signposts contain in-universe information, like the names of the locations or tips for the adventure.

![pokemon signpost tutorial](https://sunbro.dev/images/pokeemerald/littleroot_puddle_sign.png)

-> He knows about timed hits: This is a game tutorial that breaks the fourth wall, being the NPC that teaches you what button press to do certain action. This is a very common tool used in RPGs games like Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, where Toad teaches Mario how to use items and timed hits. Here there is a curious fact that if the player refuses to do the optional tutorial, Toad tells the goombas that has shown up that Mario already knows about timed hits and runs away in fear.

Another game that applies this tutorial is Persona 4, where one of the NPCs tells you how to use the square button to fast travel.

![persona 4 tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wx8VKwYUbFQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

-> Training boss: This is a location where the player can practice with some enemies to learn a bit of the controls and then arrives at a boss to show the mechanics of how to defeat the bosses that will appear through the game. The curious fact is that this first boss has to appear almost at the beginning, so lets the player get used to the game and defeat that boss later. In the title Demon’s Souls, after the little tutorial we see that there is a boss fight. This boss fight is mandatory that the player loses it so he/she can come back later and defeat it.

Another feature of this tutorial is that at the beginning the player finds enemies that cannot be defeated and are used like punching bags. We can see an example of this in the game Mother 3, which has a function in the Battle Memory that lets the player to practise combos against an unresponsive version of any enemy.

Now that we are a bit more introduced in the world of video game tutorials, it is also important to know that each tutorial is different and always depends on many factors, like the story that the game will have, its mechanics and its design, due to everything needs to be natural and also needs to have a flow so the player doesn’t get bored or frustrated so early in the game. Despite the tutorial has variations from game to game, it has to follow some rules that will be summarized in a checklist:
-> No too much text. If the tutorial game has too much text, many players will not read it and may lose an important feature of the game, kills pacing and destroys the immersion. So, the tutorial is better to be interactive and let the player learn well and with its rhythm. It is important that the player has a good experience playing the game and ensures that understands what the game is trying to teach him/her.
-> Don’t front-load the tutorial. A common error in game designing is that in the tutorials we want to put all the information possible inside the tutorial. This is such a bad idea, due to, as we said before, the tutorial must show the basics of the game and it is positive to the player to let him/her discover different mechanics by its own. So, giving everything at the beginning will overwhelm the player with information that surely will forget the half while playing, so the best would be giving some pieces at the start, and let the player discover by himself/herself.
-> Make the tutorial fun to play. The first steps in a video game are the most important because will determine if the player will continue the game. This seems so obvious, but at the time of building a tutorial, it sometimes is not engaging compared to the rest of the game. Here, the designer has to use all the features that make its game fun and also apply them to the tutorial.
-> Reinforce learning through play. Going along distributing the tutorial throughout the game is the idea of reinforcing what was taught before, by highlighting this during the game play. It is needed to help the player understand how to apply the tools learned in the tutorial, so the best option would be making the tutorial feel like it is an organic part of the game.
-> Listen to the players: In the playtesting session one of the most important parts is the tutorial, so the opinion of other people is also very important. In this step is very important to listen and comprehend what people are thinking about the game and do it as much as intuitively can be for everybody.

To show how the process for an RPG tutorial is created, I will design a prototype of my own tutorial following the checklist above.
Firstly, it is important to know the story of the game and observe which will be the main mechanics. For example, in my game I have a knight’s apprentice that has to walk a training way to get to his objective and will have to enfront different types of monsters that there are in the world.
Once we have this introduction to the world, we will use the mechanics, like for example the turn-based combat, where the main character can use a sword, spell some magic and use items in battle (represented in three squares, one for the sword, one for the spells and one for the items), but when he is not in battle, he can jump over little cliffs that are around the map.
With this information, we need that in the tutorial the game teaches the player how to enter in combat with some enemies and an escenario to practise the jump. This tutorial can be implemented at the very beginning when the player is making its first steps. For example I can use that the main character has to enter a training academy where a master will teach him the basis of the combat. In this stage the character will have to fight firstly some practise doll to learn how to attack and spell casting while the master is telling him how works every element of the UI (only in this stage I am combining different types of tutorials that I said before, like the training boss and he knows about the timed hits). Then, the player is free to do this tutorial as he/she wants because there is no limit time and let everybody learn on their own. Once the first part is finished, the main character goes to the center of the city and a random person asks the character for a street. While explaining what places the random person has to go, gets robbed of his wallet with all the money. . Fortunately, later he finds a childhood friend and decides to teach the jump to the main character. In this case, the character is brought to a training field where the player can practise the jump without risks of dying (using the antepiece type). Finally, the main character goes to fight the bandit with the knowledge of the combat academy and the jumping sessions to recover his money. In this tutorial the player can practise the main mechanics of the game safely and the fact that I am mixing the story with the tutorial will make it more organic and easy-way for the player.
